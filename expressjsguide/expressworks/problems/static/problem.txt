Apply static middleware to server index.html file without any routes. The index.html file is provided and usable via process.argv[3] value of the path to it. However, you can use you're own file with this contect:

  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>I am red!</p>
    </body>
  </html>

-----------------------------

HINTS

This you someone can call static middleware:

  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/public')));

For this exercise:

  app.use(express.static(path.join(process.argv[3])));
